        <h2> About Volleyball : </h2>
        <p id="volley_pra">On February 9, 1895 AD, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, William George Morgan, Director of Physical Education at the YMCA, created a new sports game called Mentonite to pass the time in an entertaining manner, and he preferred to play this game indoors and with any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from badminton, tennis and handball, at a time when basketball was a new sport. Volleyball was created with the understanding that it is the less rough indoor sport than YMCA member-friendly basketball.</p>
